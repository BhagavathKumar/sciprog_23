This is the code for week 9 practicals.

We check if a given matrix a magic square or not.
We include a C source header file (magic_square.h) and include its function in main.c file (where the main source code resides).
magic_square.txt and not_magic_square.txt are two files with 2 matrices that are needs to be checked.

To Compile, run:

gcc main.c
./a.out

And then enter the file name in the prompt to check the corresponding matrix is magic square or not.
