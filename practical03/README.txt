This code is for Week 3 practical.
Computing integral of tan(x) for the limits 0 to pi/3, using two methods.
Method 1 : Area under the curve of f(x) using the Trapezoidal rule for the limits 0 and pi/3
Method 2 : Actual result of tan(x) is log(2)

Our aim is to compute the integral using the two methods  and compare the results.

To complite the code:

gcc -o trap trap_p3.c -lm
